Overview
========

Apache Cassandra was initially designed at `Facebook
<https://www.cs.cornell.edu/projects/ladis2009/papers/lakshman-ladis2009.pdf>`_
using a staged event-driven architecture (`SEDA
<http://www.sosp.org/2001/papers/welsh.pdf>`_) to implement a combination of
Amazonâ€™s `Dynamo
<http://courses.cse.tamu.edu/caverlee/csce438/readings/dynamo-paper.pdf>`_
distributed storage and replication techniques combined with Google's `Bigtable
<https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//archive/bigtable-osdi06.pdf>`_
data and storage engine model. Dynamo and Bigtable were both developed to meet
emerging requirements for scalable, reliable and highly available storage
systems, but each had areas that could be improved.

Cassandra was designed as a best in class combination of both systems to meet
emerging large scale, both in data footprint and query volume, storage
requirements. As applications began to require full global replication and
always available low-latency reads and writes, it became imperative to design a
new kind of database model as the relational database systems of the time
struggled to meet the new requirements of global scale applications.

Systems like Cassandra are designed for these challenges and seek the
following design objectives:

- Full multi-master database replication
- Global availability at low latency
- Scaling out on commodity hardware
- Linear throughput increase with each additional processor
- Online load balancing and cluster growth
- Partitiond key-oriented queries
- Flexible schema
